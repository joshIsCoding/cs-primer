1. Parse the first byte of the first example line - it's the required truncation length (ie the number of bytes)
2. Use the line break carriage return encoding (I'm presuming this matches the ASCII encoding) to find all the example lines
3. Parse all trunctation bytes for each line.
4. Figure out the character boundary designation in UTF-8
5. Apply truncation by chopping off characters upto the last full character that exists within the required byte length
6. Iterate through the example lines to generate your output, then compare your output to the expectation file using `diff`
